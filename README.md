(Bonus: It also allows you to pin windows always on top.)

## Download
You can download the installer `CClose Setup.exe` [here](https://github.com/chaohershi/cclose/releases).

**Please be aware that you may get a popup message from Windows SmartScreen when running the installer.** The message would state that "Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting." This is totally normal. It takes some time for a new certificate, like the one that CClose is using, to get recognized. Nevertheless, CClose is free and minimal and contains no malware of any kind. Feel free to do a virus scan if you are worried!

To run CClose from Windows SmartScreen, click on the "More info" link and then click on the "Run anyway" button.
